 Engineering isn't about perfect solutions; <br />
 it's about doing the best you can with available resources.

I was always attracted to *things*. My bachelors in electronics led a way to 'Internet of *Things*' where I enjoyed designing connected smart devices on large scale. 
During this, I understood the potential of data and ways to exploit it.
Currently, I'm working towards analysing and predicting data from *things* (aka Machine Learning).
<br /> 
<br /> 
Besides tech, I'm an avid map-reader, aviation enthusiast and guy who likes to automize everything.
